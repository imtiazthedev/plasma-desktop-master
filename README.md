# Plasma Desktop

Plasma components are spread across various repositories. This repository, plasma-desktop, contains those specific to a desktop form-factor. Components which are more generic can be found in plasma-workspace or in individual repositories like plasma-nm for networks or plasma-pa for audio. Several applets offering "extra" functionality can be found in kdeplasma-addons.
